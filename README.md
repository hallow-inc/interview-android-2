### Requirements
* The data must be dynamic and must come from the provided API endpoint:
	https://hallow.com/interview/activity.json
* The stream of days should be broken up into weeks to display
* Every day with a streak should be displayed as a piece of the streak. For single day streaks it should be a circle, otherwise whatever component makes up the greater streak.
* Each month should show the month label on top of it

### Notes
* Most of the base code has been provided for you in this repository, feel free to use as much or as little as you would like
* For networking, Retrofit and other libs have been pre-added for your use
* Read through all TODOs and look through all files before starting
